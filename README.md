# Project 1 College Basketball Trivia Game

The College Basketball trivia game project is a simple click through of random questions and answers. You will be given ten questions and four answers to choose from for each question. The scoring is done in the following format; click the correct answer your score goes up in increments of one. If you click a incorrect answers it either decreases your score or the score goes negative number.

After receiving 10 correct answers the player wins and the games end.

# Motivation:

My love of sports, specifically basketball, motivated me to do this project.  As my first project I think I did a pretty good job blending javascript with HTML and CSS.  I will continue to improve on the functionality and the UI on my project. I want to add a difficulty level to the question which would result in a higher score (for example a 3-pointer question). 

# Brief Example Score Explanation:

This is just two examples of the positive and negative numbers on your score depending on what I click for the answers. If your score shows negative, such at the picture (-7), you will have to click 7 times then another 10 positive to win.

# Code style

No coding styles used. However, here is a snip of the array of objects used for question and answer.

Currently, the game ends when the player gets 10 points. I need to improve this part of the code function and end the game after the user completes ten questions ( no consideration whether the question is incorrect or correct).

The test of my random question as well. I provide screenshots of testing the next question chosen randomly, each answer (first, second, third, forth). Also the console.log for you. 16 is the random question pulled out of the array of object.
