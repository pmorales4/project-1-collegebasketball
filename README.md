# Project 1 College Basketball Trivia Game

The College Basketball trivia game project is a simple click through of answers and questions. You will be given ten question with a choice or four answers to choose from for each question. The scoring is done in the following format; Click a positive number your socre goes to a position number. If you click a negative answers it either decreases or is a negative number.

You have to obtain ten positive answers and you win.

# Motivation:

I was motivated to do this project because I wanted to try something I never did before. As my first project I think I did a pretty good job on the front end and back end. I will continue to improve on the project throughout it being posted on github.

# Brief Example Score Explanation:

This is just two examples of the positive and negative numbers on your score depending on what I click for the answers. If your score shows negative, such at the picture (-7), you will have to click 7 times then another 10 positive to will.

# Code style

No coding styles used. However, here is a snip of my array of objects used for question and answer.

Where I need to improve my code is within this function to fix the output of only ten question to use instead of constantly going through the questions repeatedly.
