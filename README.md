# Project 1 College Basketball Trivia Game

The College Basketball trivia game project is a simple click through of random questions and answers. You will be given ten questions and four picture answers to choose from for each question. The scoring is done in the following format; click the correct answer your score goes up in increments by one. If you click an incorrect answer it also increments by 1. There is a display for both correct and wrong answers.

You are only allowed 10 questions the player wins/loses and the games end.

# Motivation:

My love of sports, specifically basketball, motivated me to do this project. As my first project I think I did a pretty good job blending javascript with HTML and CSS. I will continue to improve on the functionality and the UI on my project. I want to add a difficulty level to the question which would result in a higher score (for example a 3-pointer question).

# Brief Example Score Explanation:

This is just one example of the scores depending on what you clicked for the answers. You can get 6 correct and 4 wrong thats it (as an example). Reset game as your only allowed 10 questions.

# Code style

No coding styles used. However, here is a snip of the array of objects used for question and answer.

Currently, the game ends when the player gets 10 points or either side (correct and wrong) add up to ten. I need to improve this part of the code function and add a modal for pop up winner.

The test of my random question as well. I provide screenshots of testing the next question chosen randomly, each answer (first, second, third, forth). Also the console.log for you. 16 is the random question pulled out of the array of object.
